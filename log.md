# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Learned JavaScript Arrays.
 
**Thoughts:** I've never taken time to learn JavaScript properly, but I've recently learned that JS is extremely important and versatile. So glad FCC teaches us about multidimensional arrays, which was only lightly touched on in my Diploma course. Also, it's really great how the challenge requires us to use GitHub, because now I'd have good, practical exercises to practice using GitHub.
